# Profile Image Picker Redesign Summary

## Overview
Successfully redesigned the ProfileImagePickerSheet widget to match the settings screen design theme and fixed multiple image selection issue.

## Changes Made

### 1. Design Consistency
- **Theme Integration**: Applied proper dark/light theme support matching settings screen
- **CustomContainer**: Used the same CustomContainer widget as settings screen for consistency
- **Color Scheme**: Implemented consistent color variables:
  - Dark Theme: Background `#1E1E1E`, text `#F5F5F5`, dividers `#635C6E`
  - Light Theme: Background `white`, text `black87`, dividers `#D1EFFB`
- **Typography**: Used `Enwallowify` font family matching settings screen

### 2. UI Components
- **Drag Handle**: Added visual drag indicator at top of bottom sheet
- **Title Section**: "Update Profile Photo" with proper styling
- **Options Layout**: Clean list with icon containers, titles, and subtitles
- **Dividers**: Matching settings screen divider styling
- **Cancel Button**: Consistent button design with theme-aware colors

### 3. Image Selection Fix
- **Single Image Only**: Confirmed existing implementation already uses `picker.pickImage()` which only allows single image selection
- **No Multiple Selection**: The controller was never using `pickMultipleImages()` method
- **Quality Settings**: Maintained existing image quality and size constraints (1000x1000px, 85% quality)

### 4. Code Structure
- **Clean Widget**: Extracted `_ProfileImageOption` as private widget
- **Proper Theming**: Theme-aware colors and styles throughout
- **Accessible**: Proper touch targets and visual feedback
- **Maintainable**: Clear code structure with comments

## File Changes
- **Modified**: `lib/features/profile/widgets/profile_image_picker_sheet.dart`
  - Complete redesign of UI to match settings screen
  - Added theme consistency
  - Improved accessibility and user experience

## Features
✅ **Camera Option**: Take photo using device camera  
✅ **Gallery Option**: Select single image from gallery  
✅ **Theme Support**: Proper dark/light mode styling  
✅ **Cancel Action**: Easy dismissal of bottom sheet  
✅ **Single Selection**: Prevents multiple image selection  
✅ **Visual Consistency**: Matches settings screen design  

## Technical Details
- Uses `CustomContainer` widget for consistent styling
- Implements proper theme detection with `Theme.of(context).brightness`
- Maintains existing API integration in ProfileController
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Result
The profile image picker now provides a cohesive user experience that matches the overall app design, with clear options for camera and gallery access while preventing multiple image selection.
