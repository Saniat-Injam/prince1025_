}
```

#### Response Format

{
  "url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_..."
}
```

### 4. Error Scenarios to Test

#### No Internet Connection
- Expected: Error message "Payment processing failed. Please try again."

#### Invalid Plan Selected
- Expected: Error message "Selected plan not found. Please try again."

#### User Not Logged In
- Expected: Error message "User not logged in. Please login again."

#### Backend API Error
- Expected: Error message from API or "Payment processing failed"

#### Invalid Checkout URL
- Expected: Error message "Invalid payment URL. Please try again."

#### Cannot Launch URL

### 5. Debugging Tips

#### Check Logs
Look for these log messages in the console:
- `ðŸ”„ Starting payment process for [plan] plan`
- `ðŸ”„ Creating checkout session with request: [request]`
- `âœ… Checkout session created successfully`
- `ðŸ”„ Opening Stripe checkout URL: [url]`
- `âœ… Stripe checkout URL opened successfully`

#### Common Issues
1. **Plan not found**: Check if API returned valid plans
2. **User ID missing**: Verify user is properly logged in
3. **URL not opening**: Check url_launcher package permissions
4. **API errors**: Verify backend endpoint and Stripe configuration

### 6. Success Indicators
- âœ… Loading states work properly
- âœ… Error messages are clear and helpful
- âœ… Stripe checkout opens in browser
- âœ… User can complete payment on Stripe
- âœ… User can return to app after payment
- âœ… Status checking dialog appears
- âœ… No crashes or unhandled exceptions

### 7. Mobile-Specific Testing

#### iOS
- Verify app can return from Safari to the app
- Test with different browsers if available

#### Android
- Verify app can return from Chrome to the app
- Test with different default browsers

### 8. Backend Verification
After successful payment, verify on your backend:
- Payment session was created
- Webhook events are received (if implemented)
- User subscription status is updated
- Database records are properly created

This testing guide ensures the complete payment flow works correctly and provides a good user experience.
