Please check the complete app on your phone and verify if there are any issues.
 If any changes are needed, please let me know. Also, kindly provide your feedback on our work. 
 I am waiting for your feedback. 

Note: This is only the front-end part, so please check the functionality and responsiveness on the phone.
For the third milestone, we will work on the back-end, and the app will become fully dynamic at that point. 
Right now, everything in the app is in a static state.

Thank you,
